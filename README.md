Tr8n Sample Application
==================

This sample application demonstrates some of Tr8n's capabilities


Installation
==================

To install the app, use:

```ssh
$ git clone https://github.com/tr8n/tr8n_rails_samples_bookface.git
$ cd tr8n_rails_samples_bookface/after
$ bundle
$ bundle exec rails s
```

Open your browser and point to:

http://localhost:3000


There are 2 folders inside that show the application before Tr8n was integrated and after.

To be able to translate any elements in the application, you must be a registered user on TranslationExchange.

Once you register as a new user, add a new application and copy the key/secret combination.

Open "config/initializers/tr8n.rb" and change the following lines:

```ruby
Tr8n.configure do |config|
  config.application = {
      :key => "YOUR KEY",
      :secret => "YOUR SECRET"
  }
end
```

This will allow you to add more languages, become app translator, and much more...
